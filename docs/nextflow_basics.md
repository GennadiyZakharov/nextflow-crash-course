Basics of Nextflow pipeline engine
==================================

## Introduction

Nextflow is the pipeline language developed by Sequester company.
Technically, it is a DSL built on top of the Groovy language.

Nextflow executes scripts and runs processes defined in it.
The biggest advantage of Nextflow is the ability to 
launch and cache data-driven processes.
For example, when you need to split a file in fixed-sized chunks 
and don't know the number of chunks.
File-driven workflow engines (like Snakemake)
seriously struggle with this kind of tasks.

The most part of Nextflow pipelines in bioinformatics
follow the template defined by NF-core.

## How Nextflow works

The Nextflow pipeline is a groovy script with additional DSL blocks
Nextflow reads and executes it as a regular script.

## Input parameters

The parameters with single dash are Nextflow parameters: `-resume`
The parameters with double dash are workflow parameters
They override defaults provided in the pipeline values

```bash
nextflow run example-01/find_matches.nf --size=5000000
```

Providing a config file overrides defaults:
```bash
nextflow -config my.config
```

## Modify and resume

Each task is executed in a separate directory under the Nextflow work directory.
All inputs are linked inside this directory from the input data location or from
previous tasks.

Nextflow tracks task executions in a task cache, a key-value store of previously executed tasks.
If you modify and resume your pipeline, only the processes that are changed will be re-executed. 
The cached results will be used for tasks that donâ€™t change.

You can enable resumability using the `-resume` option.
